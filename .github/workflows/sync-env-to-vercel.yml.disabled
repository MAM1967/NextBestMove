# DISABLED: This workflow is no longer used
# 
# Reason: We now use Doppler as the source of truth for secrets.
# Secrets are synced to Vercel via:
# - scripts/sync-doppler-to-vercel.sh (production)
# - scripts/sync-doppler-to-vercel-preview.sh (staging/preview)
#
# These scripts are run manually or as part of deployment workflows.
