## 🎯 What Is NextBestMove?

NextBestMove is an actions-first workflow app that answers the question every solo operator struggles with:

**"What should I do today to move revenue forward?"**

Instead of managing a CRM or juggling spreadsheets, you simply:
1. **Pin** people you don't want to lose track of
2. **Get** a short, realistic daily plan (3–8 actions), sized to your actual calendar
3. **Mark** actions as done / got reply / snooze
4. **Receive** a weekly summary with an insight and 1–2 content prompts

---

## 🔑 Core Features (v0.1)

### Pin, Don't Manage
- Add simple "Pins" (name + URL) for people you don't want to forget
- No CRM fields, no enrichment, no complexity
- Snooze Pins when timing isn't right; archive when done

### Follow-Up Done Right
- One-tap "Got a reply" handling
- Smart defaults for snoozing
