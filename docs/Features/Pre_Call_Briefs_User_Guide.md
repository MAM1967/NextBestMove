# Pre-Call Briefs User Guide

## Overview

Pre-Call Briefs automatically detect upcoming calls and meetings in your calendar and provide you with a quick summary of your interaction history with the person you're meeting with.

**Automatic Detection:**
- If your calendar event has a video conferencing link (Google Meet, Zoom, Teams, etc.), it will be automatically detected
- The system checks for video conferencing fields in your calendar events (most reliable method)
- If no video conferencing field is found, it falls back to checking the event title for keywords

## How It Works

Pre-Call Briefs appear on your Daily Plan page when you have calendar events in the next 24 hours that look like calls or meetings.

## Event Naming Best Practices

For Pre-Call Briefs to work, name your calendar events with keywords that indicate it's a call or meeting. The system recognizes:

### Single Keywords
- `call` - e.g., "Call with John"
- `phone` - e.g., "Phone call with Sarah"
- `zoom` - e.g., "Zoom with Mike"
- `teams` - e.g., "Teams sync with Lisa"
- `meeting` - e.g., "Meeting with Tom"
- `sync` - e.g., "Sync with Alex"
- `chat` - e.g., "Chat with Emma"
- `discussion` - e.g., "Discussion with Chris"
- `conversation` - e.g., "Conversation with Pat"
- `interview` - e.g., "Interview with Sam"
- `demo` - e.g., "Demo with Jordan"
- `consultation` - e.g., "Consultation with Taylor"
- `check-in` - e.g., "Check-in with Morgan"
- `touch base` - e.g., "Touch base with Casey"
- `catch up` - e.g., "Catch up with Riley"

### Multi-Word Phrases
- `google meet` - e.g., "Google Meet: Project Review"
- `google hangouts` - e.g., "Google Hangouts with John"
- `microsoft teams` - e.g., "Microsoft Teams sync"
- `zoom meeting` - e.g., "Zoom meeting with Sarah"
- `video call` - e.g., "Video call with Mike"
- `phone call` - e.g., "Phone call with Lisa"
- `conference call` - e.g., "Conference call with Tom"

## Examples of Good Event Titles

✅ **These will work:**
- "Call with John Smith"
- "Zoom with Sarah Johnson"
- "Google Meet: Project Review"
- "Teams sync with Mike"
- "Meeting with Lisa"
- "Video call with Tom"
- "Phone call with Alex"

❌ **These might not be detected:**
- "Coffee chat" (no keyword)
- "Lunch" (no keyword)
- "Standup" (no keyword)
- "1:1" (no keyword)

## Matching to Pinned People

Pre-Call Briefs work best when:
1. The person's name appears in the event title
2. You have that person pinned in NextBestMove

**Example:**
- Event: "Call with John Smith"
- Pin: "John Smith" (or "John" if it's a unique match)
- Result: Pre-Call Brief will show your interaction history with John

## What You'll See

When a call is detected, you'll see:
- **Last Interaction** - When you last contacted this person
- **Follow-Up History** - Total actions and replies received
- **Suggested Talking Points** - AI-generated suggestions based on your history

## Tips

1. **Be consistent** - Use the same name format in calendar events and pins
2. **Include the platform** - Adding "Zoom", "Google Meet", or "Teams" helps detection
3. **Use full names** - If you have multiple people with the same first name, use full names
4. **Pin important contacts** - Pre-Call Briefs only work for people you've pinned

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Why isn't my meeting showing a Pre-Call Brief?**
- Check that your event title includes one of the keywords above
- Verify the event is within the next 24 hours
- Make sure you have the person pinned in NextBestMove
- Check that the person's name appears in the event title

**Q: The brief shows "No previous interactions" but I've contacted this person before.**
- Make sure the person is pinned in NextBestMove
- Verify the name in the calendar event matches the pin name
- Check that you've completed actions for this person (actions create the history)

**Q: Can I customize the keywords?**
- Not yet - this is a future enhancement. For now, use the keywords listed above.
