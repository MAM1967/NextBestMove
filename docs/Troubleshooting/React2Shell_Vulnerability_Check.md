## Vercel Protection

Vercel has implemented Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules to mitigate known exploit patterns for React2Shell. However, **upgrading to patched versions is still the recommended solution** as WAF rules may not catch all attack vectors.

---

## Action Required

**None** - The application is already using patched versions.

### If You See a Warning in Vercel:

1. **Verify package.json versions:**
   ```bash
   cd web
   npm list next react react-dom
   ```

2. **Confirm versions are:**
   - `next@16.0.7` or later patched version
   - `react@19.2.1` or `react@19.1.2` or `react@19.0.1`

3. **If versions are correct but warning persists:**
   - Clear Vercel build cache
   - Redeploy the application
   - Check Vercel dashboard → Security → Dependencies for latest scan

---

## Monitoring

### Regular Checks:

1. **Check for updates:**
   ```bash
   npm outdated next react react-dom
   ```

2. **Security audit:**
   ```bash
   npm audit
   ```

3. **Vercel Security Dashboard:**
   - Navigate to: Vercel Dashboard → Project → Security
   - Review dependency vulnerabilities regularly

---

## Upgrade Path (If Needed)

If you ever need to upgrade from a vulnerable version:

```bash
cd web

# Update Next.js to latest patched version
npm install next@latest

# Update React (if needed)
npm install react@latest react-dom@latest

# Verify versions
npm list next react react-dom

# Test locally
npm run dev

# Type check
npm run type-check
```
