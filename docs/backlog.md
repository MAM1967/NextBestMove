## 🔴 P0 – MVP Must-Haves

### Foundation & Billing

- [ ] **Project initialization & tooling**  
       _Next.js 14 + TypeScript, Tailwind tokens, ESLint/Prettier, React Query, Zustand scaffold_

- [ ] **Supabase schema & migrations**  
       _All core tables (users, pins, actions, plans, summaries, calendar, billing) + enums, RLS, helper functions_

- [x] **Stripe API routes (checkout & portal)** ✅  
       _`POST /api/billing/create-checkout-session` (support Standard/Professional plans, monthly/annual), `POST /api/billing/customer-portal`, env wiring. Support 14-day trial creation via Stripe API (no credit card required, `trial_period_days: 14`)_

- [x] **Stripe webhook + subscription sync** ✅  
       _Verify signature, store events, upsert `billing_customers` / `billing_subscriptions`, update session status. Handle trial expiration (via `customer.subscription.updated` when trial ends), payment failures, cancellations, and plan upgrades/downgrades. Stripe automatically manages trial status transitions_

- [x] **Supabase Auth pages & profile bootstrap** ✅  
       _Sign up / sign in, default timezone + streak info stored on user record_

- [x] **Paywall middleware & base overlay** ✅  
       _Read-only mode when subscription inactive, PaywallOverlay renders on gated pages. Support 14-day trial (full access), 7-day read-only grace period, and plan-based feature gating (Standard vs Professional). PaywallOverlay component created, subscription status checking implemented, plan page protected_

### Pins & Actions

- [x] **Pin management UI + API** ✅  
       _Pin CRUD endpoints, filters (All/Active/Snoozed/Archived), Add/Edit modals, Snooze/Archive/Restore_

- [x] **Action engine core** ✅  
       _Action card component, Done/Got reply/Snooze handlers, FollowUpFlowModal + scheduling defaults_

### Daily Plan

- [x] **Plan generation service** ✅  
       _Capacity calculation, Fast Win selection, priority scoring, `daily_plan_actions` writes_

- [x] **Daily Plan page UI** ✅  
       _Header, focus card, progress indicator, Fast Win card, action list, empty state_

- [x] **Make action priority ranking obvious to users** ✅  
       _Priority scoring works but ordering logic is not clear. Add visual indicators (priority badges, urgency indicators), tooltips explaining why actions are prioritized, or sorting options. Users should understand why actions appear in the order they do._

- [x] **Stale actions insight & algorithm v2** ✅  
       _Surface actions older than 7 days that remain in NEW state (not snoozed). Provide insight/report UI, and update plan-generation algorithm documentation to "v2" once implemented._

### Calendar Integration

- [x] **Google & Outlook OAuth flows** ✅  
       _Connect/disconnect endpoints, token storage, error handling, optional skip_

- [x] **Free/busy API + status indicators** ✅  
       _Cached free/busy fetch, fallback to default capacity, Settings status block, disconnect action_

- [x] **Customizable working hours (onboarding preference)** ✅  
       _Allow users to set their working hours (e.g., 9-5, 10-6, 8-8) during onboarding. Currently hardcoded to 9 AM - 5 PM. This is a STANDARD feature (not premium) because it's core functionality - the app won't work correctly for many users without it. Similar to timezone - a fundamental configuration setting. Store in `users` table as `work_start_time` and `work_end_time` (TIME type). Update capacity calculation and calendar events filtering to use custom hours. Implemented in onboarding Step 4 and Settings → Account Overview._

### Weekly Summary & Content

- [x] **Weekly summary metrics job** ✅  
       _Aggregate stats, placeholder narrative/insight/content prompts, schedule job. Implemented as cron job via cron-job.org, generates summaries and sends emails if enabled._

- [x] **Weekly Summary page** ✅  
       _Metrics grid, narrative card, insight, focus confirmation, content prompts section_

- [x] **Content prompt generation** ✅  
       _Template + AI fallback for win/insight posts, saved to `content_prompts` table. OpenAI integration with BYOK support for premium users._

- [x] **Copy to clipboard for content prompts** ✅  
       _Add "Copy to clipboard" button for content prompts on Weekly Summary page_

### Onboarding

- [x] **Onboarding flow (8 steps)** ✅  
       _Welcome → pin → optional calendar → working hours → weekend preference → weekly focus → first plan ready → start 14-day trial (no credit card). No early pricing screens - let rhythm sell the plan. Implemented with localStorage persistence for OAuth redirects, final step changed from "fast win coaching" to "start free trial"._

### Settings & Export

- [x] **Settings page framework** ✅  
       _Sections for calendar, notifications, timezone, content prompts, streak, data export_

- [x] **Billing section UI** ✅  
       _BillingSection component showing plan, status badge, renewal date, manage billing CTA_

- [x] **Data export endpoint** ✅  
       _Download JSON of pins/actions/plans/summaries + button in Settings_

- [x] **Email preferences & account deletion controls** ✅  
       _Email preferences UI with toggles for morning plan, fast win reminder, follow-up alerts, weekly summary. Unsubscribe from all emails option. Account deletion with full data removal and auth.users deletion. High P1 – required to meet compliance expectations._

### Background Jobs & Observability

- [x] **Background jobs** ✅  
       _Daily plan cron, weekly summary cron, auto-unsnooze, auto-archive. Implemented via cron-job.org (4 jobs total). Includes notification cron jobs: morning plan, fast win reminder, follow-up alerts._

- [x] **Observability setup** ✅  
       _GlitchTip for error tracking (Sentry-compatible SDK), Umami for privacy-focused analytics, structured logging utility with GlitchTip integration for billing + webhooks. See `docs/Observability.md` for details._

### Dashboard & Settings Data

- [x] **Dashboard data integration** ✅  
       _Dashboard now fetches and displays user-specific data: today's daily plan, fast win action, regular actions count, progress, streak count, and calendar availability. Removed placeholder tasks table query._

- [x] **Content prompts & streak data in settings** ✅  
       _Settings page now shows count of saved content prompts. Streak count displays correctly from user profile. Content prompts toggle remains disabled (coming soon feature)._

- [x] **Optimize GitHub Actions env sync with change data capture** ✅  
       _Modified GitHub Actions workflow to only sync environment variables that don't already exist in Vercel. Fetches existing variables first using 'vercel env ls', compares with GitHub Secrets, and skips existing ones. Reduces API calls, speeds up execution, and provides clearer logs with sync statistics. See `docs/Environment_Variables_Sync_Optimization_Plan.md` for details._

- [x] **Account overview: Password change & timezone editing** ✅  
       _Allow users to change password and update timezone in Settings → Account overview. Timezone dropdown with common options for travelers/remote workers. Password change requires confirmation._

Completed and tested - all Group 3 tests passed: low completion detection, 7+ day inactivity comeback plan, high completion streak boost, celebration banner, Day 2-6 micro mode auto-enable, Day 3 email, Day 7 billing pause detection.)
- [x] **Content Ideas list page** ✅ (saved prompts CRUD + empty state. Page created with filtering, copy, archive, and delete functionality.)

- [x] **Win-back campaign automation** ✅ (Day 7, 30, 90, 180 post-cancellation emails via Resend. Completed and tested - cron job created, uses existing email templates, only sends to voluntary cancellations, skips payment failures. Feedback form created and working. All Group 2 tests passed.)
- [ ] **Professional plan features** (Unlimited pins + premium features in priority order: 1) Pattern detection, 2) Pre-call briefs, 3) Performance timeline, 4) Content engine with voice learning)
- [ ] **Plan downgrade handling** (Professional → Standard: pin limit warning, Standard → Cancel: 7-day read-only + 30-day reactivation)
- [ ] **Display weekly focus on Daily Plan page** (Fetch `next_week_focus` from `weekly_summaries` table and display in focus card. Currently shows hardcoded placeholder. Part of US-7.6 - high priority for user engagement and context.)
